# Why do you need a website?
This website will be a niche authority website and a community resource

# What's your vision?
I'm not sure how / if I will monetize the site.
Nor am I clear on what I hope it will create for me.
This was created more out of a sense of Mission.

# What's your mission?
Visitors (members?) of this site will acquire the information and knowledge
they need to be able to make informed decisions on raising their children.
They will be able to make these decisions with a sense of confidence and
peace, regardless of external opinion, pressure, etc.

# Who is your ideal customer?
I am targeting parents who are new to raising children in a vegan lifestyle.
These can be either people who are just having children or parents who
already have children and have made the decision to switch to veganism.
My ideal customer is committed to living a vegan lifestyle, but is a bit
nervous and stressed about all the pressure s/he is receiving from people
who hold the opinion that it's unhealthy and / or unwise for children to
be vegan.
My ideal customer wants to ensure that s/he is able to provide a wide
variety of healthy, enjoyable food to her/his family.
My ideal customer wants to know that s/he is making choices based on facts
that s/he can verify for her/himself.
My ideal customer is looking for guidance and support as s/he travels
this road of vegan parenthood.

# What's your style?
Authoritative AND Approachable.
No-nonsense AND Warm.
Commanding respect AND Compassionate.
Direct AND Tactful.

# What does your customer need to know?
My customer needs to know the facts.
S/he needs to be able to access primary resources from reputable sources.
S/he needs nutritional information and recipes.
S/he needs tools and techniques to talk to her/his children.

# How will your customers access your website?
As far as state of mind, initially my customers are likely to be somewhat
stressed and anxious about being able to make the right choices.
My customers will find out about the site through organic search results.
They will likely first enter the site by reading one of the articles
posted on the site.
While my customers will probably have first visited the site on a non-mobile
device, they will ultimately be accessing it more from mobile devices
as they are out and about and need to easily access the information to help
them make decisions on the spot.
The site needs to have a structured, easily navigable interface optimized for
mobile devices.
